Hi, my name is Zach and this is my personal blog. I will be posting weekly as I go through the Awesome.inc coding bootcamp.
## A couple questions from the bootcamp so far...

**Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**

So far the first week of bootcamp has been mostly what I expected. I definitely was expecting a challenge, and it has been challenging so far. Github has been the hardest part for me to learn. I'm looking forward to getting familiar with it.

**What are you excited or eager to learn more about?**

I am eager to begin working with javscript more. A friend of mine uses javascript for his job and loves it.

**What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?**

I love coffee, sports, dogs, trucks, videogames, and hopefully coding soon.
